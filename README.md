# Python_and_R_Sample_ETLs
Few samples of Python and R ETLs that I have built during my service at American Family Insurance. These ETLs are focused on Extracting the data from the rating matrices 
(Each Line of business has rating matrix), and transform it to uploadable file fomrat of Majesco tool named Dev Studio. Reports of data quality is being built at the same time.
All the uploadable files are being expoted at once, with their changed name and structure, along with the report.

Samples here given are related to Commercial Auto LoB only.
